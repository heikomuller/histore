    Parameters
    ----------
    archive: histore.archive.reader.ArchiveReader
        Reader for archive containing previous snapshots of the dataset.
    doc_reader: histore.document.reader.DocumentReader
        Reader for rows in the merged dataset snapshot.
    version: int
        Identifier of the new archive version.
    writer: histore.archive.writer.ArchiveWriter
        Consumer for rows in the new archive version.
    partial: bool, default=False
        Flag indicating whether the given document is a partial document. For
        partial documents missing rows in the archive are considered unchanged
        with respect to the given origin.
    unchanged_cells: set, default=None
        Set of identifier for columns whose cell values are not included in
        the values dictionary for document rows but that remain unchanged with
        respect to the specified source version (origin).
    origin: int, default=None
        Version that the row values originate from. Rows that remain unchanged
        have the timestamp extended for the version of origin.
